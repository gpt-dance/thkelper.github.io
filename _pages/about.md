🐚 Hi there! I’m **Changpeng Yang (杨昌澎)**, a researcher at HyperAI Team, Xiaomi, working on **multimodal reasoning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **GUI Agents**. I received my M.S. from Peking University (PKU) and B.S. from the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology (USST).

My long-term vision is to develop **dynamic reinforcement learning mechanisms for multimodal foundation models**, emphasizing **genuine exploration** and continual capability growth toward Artificial General Intelligence(AGI).

😊 I am always eager to collaborate, explore ideas, and push the boundaries toward AGI together.
Please feel free to reach out!
