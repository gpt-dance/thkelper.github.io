🐚 Hi there! I am currently a researcher at the **HyperAI Team, Xiaomi**, where my research focuses on **GUI Agents**, **multimodal reasoning**, and **reinforcement learning**.  Before that, I received my M.S. degree from Peking University (PKU) and my B.S. degree from the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology (USST).

My long-term vision is to explore **dynamic reinforcement learning mechanisms for multimodal foundation models**, with a particular focus on **meaningful exploration of reinforcement learning**, enabling continual capability growth and contributing to the realization of **general intelligence**.

😊 I am always eager to collaborate, exchange ideas, and push the boundaries toward artificial general intelligence together.
Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration or discussion.
